            <p style="color: rgb(104, 104, 104);">
              When we usually talk about sin, we think of external crimes such as murder, robbery, adultery, and fraud. However, the Bible points out that not only external crimes but also pride, jealousy, hatred, envy, greed, and lust are internal sins.

          <h5>What is the original sin of human?</h5>
          <p>
            <h10
            style="color: rgb(29, 29, 29);">The Bible clearly states that humans are sinners. The term sinner is not a name given to humans because they committed a legal or conscientious sin after being born into the world. The name sinner was given to humans before they were born into the world.</h10>
            </p>

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
                When we realize that we are sinners from the moment we are born, we realize that we absolutely need a Savior in our lives. In theology, the term 'original sin' is often used. This term refers to the sin that Adam's sin was inherited by mankind. Regardless of the state in which we are born, the environment in which we live, or our status, the Bible clearly teaches that all humans are born as sinners from the womb.

        <h2>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(31, 31, 31);">"..But at the same time, we are humans."</h3>
          </h2>
        <h5>
          <h6 style="color: rgb(57, 57, 57);">We must strive to become better</h6>
          </h5>
          <p>
          </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(107, 107, 107);">
              The image of God and sin are in opposition to each other. Just as good and evil cannot coexist, the image of God and sin cannot coexist. Nevertheless, good and evil, the image of God and sin coexist in one human being. This is because the image of God in human beings is not given in a complete form, but is given to be complete in the future, and therefore is always imperfect in this life.</p>
              
          </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(196, 196, 196);">
              We are accustomed to making a dichotomous distinction between good and evil people. However, this distinction is not absolute but relative. In other words, there are not completely good people and completely evil people, but only relatively more good people and relatively more evil people. In all people, there is both a good heart and an evil heart, and therefore, at times, they act good and at times, they act evil. 
</a></p></p>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
Therefore, we must face our true nature and our inner sin and move forward to atone for it, for that is the only way we can conform to our fate.
