            <p style="color: rgb(182, 182, 182);">The reason I chose "The Temptation of Adam and Eve" is because this story goes beyond a simple mythological event and reveals the essential problems of human nature. The forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden is not just a fruit, but symbolizes human desire, curiosity, and the instinct to overcome one's own limits. In the face of this temptation, humans lose their innocence and become aware of their sin, which is the beginning of original sin and an important moment that shows the tragic beauty of human existence. Through this story, I wanted to express the fact that humans are beings who cannot avoid sin by nature, but who are beings who constantly try to find meaning. Ultimately, I decided that 'The Temptation of Adam and Eve' was the most appropriate story to explore the topic of human sin, as it is a narrative that raises philosophical questions about choice, responsibility, and free will, as well as human weakness.</p>

          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(70, 70, 70);">The reason I chose "The Sin" is because this painting very explicitly and symbolically reveals the sinfulness and desire that exist deep within the human mind. The facial expressions and atmosphere of the figure in the work go beyond simple temptation and dramatically show the process through which humans long for the forbidden and ultimately fall into sin. Through this work, I wanted to express that humans are not inherently perfect beings, and that they constantly live with a tendency toward sin and the resulting moral conflict. "The Sin" is not just a simple depiction of external behavior, but it also visually and powerfully conveys how closely the concept of sin is intertwined with human existence, and I think this also touches on the theme of original sin and corruption of humans, and the suffering and responsibility that comes from it.            </p>

          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The reason I chose "A Man Drinking: 'Gluttony'" is because this work clearly exposes the endless desires of humans and the failure of self-control. Gluttony is not simply the act of excessively consuming food, but symbolizes the inner sinfulness that is revealed when humans cannot control pleasure and desire. The character in the work appears to be living an ordinary life on the outside, but his excessive drinking ultimately hints at the weakness and self-destructive tendencies that exist within humans. Through this work, I wanted to reveal that humans are contradictory beings who instinctively pursue pleasure, but who recognize their sins in the process but cannot escape them. Ultimately, I chose the subject of "A Man Drinking: 'Gluttony'" because I felt it symbolically represented the constant conflict between human nature and morality, and between self-control and depravity.

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The reason I chose "Inferno" is because it shows the ultimate consequences of sin in a visually vivid way. The image of hell and the images of suffering souls go beyond mere religious symbols and clearly reveal where human sin ultimately leads. This work shows without reservation how tragic the end of a life chosen by human desire and instinct can be, and strongly demands that we take responsibility for our sins and reflect on morality. Through this work, I wanted to express that humans have the freedom to sin, but at the same time, they are placed in a fateful structure where they cannot avoid judgment and suffering for that sin. "Inferno" is a work that depicts the essential sinfulness of humans and the ultimate consequences that they must face because of it in an extreme and symbolic way, so I felt it was a good work for contemplating human sin.

          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The reason I chose "Gethsemane" is because this work deeply illuminates the inner self of a being who endures pain to atone for the sins of mankind. The Garden of Gethsemane is not simply a place of prayer, but a space where Jesus experienced extreme agony and loneliness just before taking on all the sins of mankind. This scene symbolically contains the fate of a sinless being who takes on the sins of mankind, and how heavy and desperate that sin is. Through this work, I wanted to share that humans are too weak to bear their own sins, and that they are ultimately beings who cannot be saved without someone's sacrifice. "Gethsemane" is a work that makes us think about the nature of sin, the suffering that comes from it, and the value of love and sacrifice to bear that sin. I think it has powerful symbolism that allows us to look more deeply into human sin.

          />
          <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">I chose "Atonement" because it delicately and symbolically captures human sin and the painful journey to wash away that sin. The concept of 'atonement' is not simply forgiveness, but rather comes from a deep awareness of sin, a face-to-face confrontation with one's own wrongdoings, and an inner change to accept the price. The facial expressions of the characters in the work, the contrast between light and dark, and the symbolic gestures all reveal the human yearning for salvation amidst guilt. Through this work, I wanted to share that while committing sin may be human nature, the effort to face that sin and take responsibility for it is also part of humanity.' "Atonement" illuminates the complex relationship between human sin and redemption, between sacrifice and restoration, reminding us that even in sin, human beings still have the potential to long for transformation and salvation.          </p>

          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The reason I chose "King David Doing Penance" is because this work strongly reveals the inner pain of a person sincerely repenting for the sins he has committed and trying to pay the price for them. King David was originally a person who followed God's will, but his sins reveal the weakness and frail nature of humans. However, he deeply acknowledges his mistakes and performs a ritual of atonement, and in the process, he shows a strong will to face his sins and responsibility. Through this work, I wanted to share that although humans have a nature that cannot help but sin, true repentance and atonement for that sin provide an opportunity for humans to reflect on and change their inner selves. I chose this artwork because I thought "King David Doing Penance" symbolically depicts the pain of sin and artistically well shares the sincere effort toward atonement and the inner conflict experienced in the process.

          <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The reason I chose "Atonement Drawing" is because this work delicately reveals the deep anguish and conflict within a human being through the theme of atonement. The person in the painting seriously reproaches himself for his sins and does not hide his strong will to wash away those sins and his inner pain. Through this work, I wanted to visually express the reflection on the sins committed by humans and the inner conflict they experience because of them. "Atonement Drawing" fully conveys the emotions of the person who feels the weight of sin, and is a work that explores the process of sin and atonement not simply as a moral concept, but on a sensory and human level.          </p>
