          <h2>
            <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Do you think humans are inherently good or evil creatures?</h3>
            </h2>

          <p>
            <h10 style="color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">No matter what you think, I believe that humans are inherently evil creatures. Although the current society guarantees individual justice, rights, and freedom through the system of law, order, and democracy, and has achieved social ethics and respect through this, inside that shiny mask, I know that cruel, ugly, and disgusting human nature exists. Humans gradually evolve in intellect and reason, wear clothes, and talk about equality, but behind the light, they still commit crimes for pleasure and selfishness and are jealous of others. Nevertheless, I think that humans are beautiful creatures, and the reason is because of 'human beliefs.'</h10>
            </p>
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(165, 165, 165);">All creatures living in this world have desires and egos. And in extreme situations, they only value and care about themselves more than anything else. Because there is a primal fear and instinct of a creature that does not want to die, this is actually a bit of a cruel history, but it can be proven through the results of experiments by Japan's Unit 731. The content of the experiment is to learn about human maternal love by placing a baby and its mother on a grill in a small room and gradually raising the temperature. Among humankin's noble sacrificial spirit and love, one thing that can be said to be particularly great is the maternal love of a parent or mother. Motherly love is the willingness to sacrifice for one's child without any compensation despite any trials and tribulations, and the strong love for the child who contains one's genes. In fact, the mother in the experiment gritted her teeth for a while to protect her child. However, when the temperature of the grill reached the same level as that of the frying pan, the mother lost her temper and placed the baby on the floor and climbed on top of it to avoid pain. In other words, it shows that when it reaches its limit, love such as motherly love eventually collapses due to the primal nature of humans.</p>
          </p>
          <br />
  
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118);">But at the same time, humans sometimes make biologically nonsensical choices that go against their own desires and sacrifice for the sake of complete strangers. This is proven through the natural ecosystem, where many animals sacrifice for their family or the same species. However, these actions occur because it is in the interest of their survival. Speaking of family, even beasts sacrifice for their children but may abandon them if the children are weak and incapable of action. Because in the cruel world of nature, only the strong can survive. Also, from a species perspective, for example, crabs that have relatively hard shells climb on weaker crabs to protect them from being eaten by predators such as stingrays. This is also an action that assumes that they help each other, but that by helping others, they also receive help from them.</p>
            </p>
          <br />
    
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84);">However, there are times when humans sacrifice themselves and go against their own desires to save others without expecting anything in return. This is probably due to 'belief,' a characteristic that only humans have. Humans sometimes give up their lives for the greater good, a country, an ideology, etc., for things different from survival. Even though they are good or evil, in the end, the beliefs they hold are all great.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(52, 52, 52);">Another reason that proves this is 'human free will.' The emotion of hatred is almost the highest priority among the emotions harbored by living things. For example, being killed by an unreasonable disaster or murder to the existence of a family or friendly relationship with a specific creature, such as a daughter being killed by other person, a father going into a vegetative state due to someone else's mistake, or a friend dying due to someone else's drowsy driving arouses tremendous hatred in them and causes them to lose their rationality by the revenge. This phenomenon includes not only humans but also animals. When animals noticed that their children have been murdered, they instinctively harbor hatred and revenge. And then they actually try to implement it.</p>
          </p>
        
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Humans are also the same in this respect, but there is a big difference between humans and animals, and that is that humans have 'free will.' Beasts do not have the option or choice of giving up revenge and forgiving the object of their hatred. However, humans can suppress this hatred, endure it, and eventually forgive it. By forgiving, they are able to break the chain of hatred. This is nonsense from a biological point of view. Because even though your family died for an unreasonable reason, you can have the mind to forgive them.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In other words, unlike other creatures, humans are capable of making the choice to continue pursuing bloody revenge against the object of hatred and the choice to forgive to let go of regret and resentment and move toward the future rather than the past. It means that humans have 'free will' to choose their own fate. Some humans give up thinking, give in to their primal emotions and desires, and head into the endless abyss just for revenge. However, despite despair, collapse, and frustration, some people continue to move forward by choosing their own path, enduring trials and tribulations, forgetting the past, and forgiving. Therefore, we can say that people are beautiful creatures despite their evil nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In conclusion, I think that humans are sinful and evil beings, but they are also wonderful creatures who struggle to become better people by facing their own desires and sins themselves for their own beliefs and freedom, by atonement, and those make 
                  me believe in human's potential. Therefore, we too, as people who sometimes resist, sometimes obey, and sometimes conform to fate, must continue to atone and prove ourselves to become better.

                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Firstly, the reason I chose Michelangelo's "The Temptation of Adam and Eve" is because, from a Christian perspective, this painting depicts the scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from paradise after eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the first sin, and is one of the most symbolic works and the origin of discussing human sin.
                </p>
                <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Secondly, the reason I chose "The Sin" by Heinrich Lossow is because I found it very interesting that these people, who had extremely high authority and status in the Middle Ages, forgot their honorable positions and described in detail human desires, vices, and human indulgence through the temptation of pleasure.
                  <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thirdly, the reason why I choose Jacques de L'Ange's "A Man Drinking: 'Gluttony'" is because I liked the subtle revelation of binge eating through this, one of the seven sins of humans. Clothes are often meant to cover up and dress up our shameful raw bodies, so much so that they forget to dress up to satisfy their hunger and thirst, that they look like parasites robbing and stealing from their hosts.
                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fourthly, the reason I chose Herri met de Bles' "Inferno" is because the image of hell, filled with the debauchery and endless orgy of sin of humans corrupted by desire, was so horrible that it seemed to clearly show their end soaked in sin. Those who forget their beliefs and the path toward freedom are no different from beasts, and they become slaves to desire and pleasure and will pay the price for their sins for eternity.
                      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Fifthly, the reason I chose Adam Abram's "Gethsemane" is because the work's immersion in which the weakness and frustration of Jesus, the son of the omnipotent Father in Christianity, can be felt naturally caught my attention right away. The helpless and seemingly hopeless posture of Jesus, the only begotten Son and savior who everyone looks up to, seems very miserable, as if there is no hope at all.
                        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Sixthly, the reason I chose Glen Sanders' "Atonement" is because the work humorously depicts the original sin of Adam and Eve, the incidents and accidents that occur throughout Christianity, and even Jesus' death on the cross to atone for it, as if saying that all of this is meaningless and foolish, leaving me with a bitter yet relieved feeling, which was lukewarm. Even if it is the long history of mankind, when viewed from the perspective of the vast universe, or from the perspective of an omnipotent God, maybe everything seems so futile.
                          <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Seventhly, the reason I chose Albrecht Dürer's "King David Doing Penance" is because the image of self-reflection and atonement through physical and mental pain and self-harm was barbaric, but also because the background and appearance of it becoming so natural that even a king would choose this method of atonement felt sad. In fact, it overlapped with the way many modern young people relieve mental stress and become accustomed to it by experiencing self-loathing.
                            <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Lastly, the reason I chose Christopher Oddie's "Atonement Drawing" is that, although atonement can be viewed as a punishment and judgment, it is also a pilgrimage to seek forgiveness and reflection. I felt especially interested in the way they, suffering from their own sins, sought forgiveness from each other and found peace. The path to atonement must be painful and arduous, but only by forgiving ourselves can we move forward.
