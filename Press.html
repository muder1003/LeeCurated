          <p></p>
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(59, 59, 59);">The Exhibition, "Fatetale" conveys that sin is a longing rooted in the very nature of humanity. Its existence extends beyond our individual actions, and continues in our unfulfilled choices and unconfessed wounds. Atonement is not a simple ritual or a redemption, but a process of facing this sin through deep self-examination and seeking genuine change within it. At the intersection of sin and atonement, we do not stop at a mere personal purification. It is a journey that confronts the fundamental question of human existence—how we should live.            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(19, 19, 19);">The works of Michelangelo, Heinrich Lossow, Jacques de L'Ange, and Herri met de Bles delve deeply into the nature of human sin and vice. From different periods and perspectives, these artists embody the weight of sin and the inner pain it causes, inviting us to reflect on the reality of evil and its morality. This exhibition reminds us that sin is not simply an ethical concept, but a mirror that reflects the fundamental contradictions and conflicts of human existence. Look for traces of the struggle to face our dark nature and overcome it.              </p>
              </p> 

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The works of Adam Abram, Glen Sanders, Albrecht Dürer, and Christopher Oddie explore the possibility of atonement and redemption beyond human sin. The exhibition unfolds around the awareness of sin and the suffering it causes, as well as the faith and free will to overcome it. Each work explores how humans change and seek redemption despite their sin, and tells a story of internal conflict and growth in the process. Through their agony and hope, we reflect on human nature and the unyielding will for a better future.                </p>
              </p>
              <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Curated by Michael Lee, this exhibition explores the intricate relationship between human belief, will, and the forces of fate. The exhibition reflects on humanity's struggle against the inevitable currents of fate. Ultimately, it suggests that through this dynamic of resistance and obedience, we can find the path to conform and enlightenment, shedding light on the enduring power of human virtue and the transformative strength of belief.</p>
            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">"what is really important is that we must follow a path that conforms to fate, rather than blindly resisting or obeying fate. No matter how unreasonable the world is or how much you don’t like it, there is no point in complaining about the world or society and looking for the cause. Because that’s just a waste of time. The world is inherently unfair. Sometimes, the world is like that, so let go of your resentment, calmly acknowledge the irrationality, obey, and think about how to move forward in the midst of that irrationality. However, it is not good to always do only what is given and to remain silent and ignore changes. When opposition and counterattack are necessary, you must also be able to resist accordingly. Because there is change, there is also progress. In other words, you must be a human being who sometimes obeys fate, but sometimes knows how to resist fate, does not just follow everything, and has a critical mind that can distinguish between right and wrong. Fate will never change. Ultimately, one day, all life will die and return to dust. However, we can take several actions before we reach that fate. The results aren't important. What truly matters is the process of reaching that result. Isn't that the way for humans to conform to fate, which is both a resistance that can fight against fate and an obedience that also follows fate? If so, how are you going to swim in this river called Fate?"</p>
